# Project Overview üöÄ

This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Hugging Face model(Llama 7b-hf chat model) using bitsandbytes and PEFT for efficient language modeling. The model is loaded, the dataset is preprocessed, and fine-tuning is performed.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

## Usage ü§ñ

### Loading the Model

In this step, import the required functions from your module responsible for loading the pre-trained model. This ensures the project starts with a robust foundation.

### Preprocessing Dataset

Prepare the dataset for fine-tuning by importing functions from your module to handle preprocessing. This step is crucial for optimizing data compatibility with the chosen model.

### Fine-tuning

Import functions from your module for the fine-tuning process. This step adapts the pre-trained model to better suit the specific language modeling requirements.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### BitsAndBytes Config

Configure the bitsandbytes settings by importing relevant functions from your module. This step ensures efficient utilization of bitsandbytes during the fine-tuning process.

### PEFT Config

Adjust the PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) settings by importing functions from your module. Fine-tune the model's parameters to achieve optimal language modeling results.
